    <p>a passionate web developer 5 years into a mission to push the boundaries of technology and creativity.</p>
    
    <p> Alongside that, I've mastered the powerful features of React and TypeScript during my postgraduate studies, expanding my toolkit for building dynamic, efficient web applications.
     
     With a solid foundation in front-end web development from my tech degree at Treehouse, I've delved, dived, jumped....went way down into... deep into the world of web technologies.
 </p>
     <p>This is how I learned W3CSS, following W3 Schools Curriculum, I created the website that gets built out as the result of documenting the journey through the documentation.
     This is what I recommend for any beginner that really wants to know a framework...write it out while building what it says...as we complete the courses and then I will have in one repo a code snippet for every single feature of the framework (WITH SOLID NOTES!)
     while solidifying my capabilities, a flawless plan!</p>

  <p>A car is a wheeled, self-powered motor vehicle used for transportation.
  Most definitions of the term specify that cars are designed to run primarily on roads,
  to have seating for one to eight people, to typically have four wheels. (Wikipedia)</p>
